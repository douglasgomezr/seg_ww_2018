Links for learning at the working workshop

I am collecting some useful tutorial information for the 2018 working workshop 
at https://github.com/kschleicher/seg_ww_2018.   A quickstart guide to git read
the 8-minute guide to GitHub and how developers use it to share code:

If you have git installed on your computer you can clone the seg_ww_2018 
repository with:
cd 'directory you want to put the git directory seg_ww.2018'
git clone https://github.com/kschleicher/seg_ww_2018
You can now "cd seg_ww_2018" and checkout this tutorial material.  This file is

   Installing Anaconda python distribution â€“ you need to google for 
       instructions.

also read the "advanced installation" guide about prerequisites that must be 
installed.

Learning python
   Jupyter notebook- To learn a litle read:
       getting_started_with_jupyter_notebooks.txt 
   Mathlab users may find NumPy4MATLAB_users.pdf useful
   More information is in getting_started_with_python.txt
   There are video tutorials for basic python, numpy, and matplotlib from 
       2017 scipy conference  at:
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5GfdAFycPLBdUDOUtdQIVoMf
       I recommend:
            Software Carpentry Scientific Python Course.  If you already know 
               it, skip the linux portion of the video.      
            Introduction to Numerical Computing with NumPy
            Anatomy of Matplotlib    
  
   Read and writ Madagascar data: simple_m8r_create_write_filter_read.ipynb
   Reading and writing segy data:
       Segyio is a small LGPL licenced C library with binding for Python3 and 
           Matlab. The file:
            https://github.com/Statoil/segyio/blob/master/README.md includes 
            sections on how to get segyio and a tutorial with examples.
   TLE tutorials can inspite.  read:
      https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Geophysical_tutorials
      clone:
      git clone http://github.com/seg/tutorials
      cd tutorials
      git clone http://github.com/seg/tutorials-2016
      cd tutorials-2016/1610_Facies_Classification
      jupyter notebook
      read
        https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Facies_classification_using_machine_learning

   Many are motivated to work on machine learning. Read the previous 
   	Facies_classification_using_machine_learning
      git clone http://github.com/seg/2016-ml-contest
   Many are interested in python to work in tensorflow to develop 
      Convolutional Neural Nets (CNN's).  This is an advanced topic.  There 
      is an online coursera by Andrew Ng at coursera.  There are 5 sections to
      the class, each is about 5 weeks.  They cost about $50 each.  I think 
      fast.ai is free. Maybe you know others,
