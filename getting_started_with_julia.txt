I am preparing for the “Working Workshop – Python and Julia for Geophysics” in August 8-11, 2018. I have recently become interested in Julia because it provides fast execution rates like C and Fortran with easy memory management and interpretive execution like Python. Julia also allows existing functions written in other languages (e.g. C, Fortran, Python) to be easily called. I believe this collection of links to tutorials, cheat sheets, and examples geophysical code will help me learn more about Julia.
