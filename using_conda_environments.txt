•I often want to preserve my Python configuration when I try something new like:
   –Try Python 3 and leave Python 2 as my default
   –Avoid cluttering my system by installing a package when you just want to 
     experiment.
•If you are using Anaconda python distribution (a good idea) this is easy.  
  Get AncondaPython at:
     https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos

# make the environment (takes 15 min on my Mac on UT’s wifi)
conda create -n myenv python=3.6 ipython jupyter seaboard
# start it in a single terminal (this runs quickly)
source activate myenv
# install obspy.  It will be there if you deactivate and reactivate myenv
conda install obspy
# start notebook
jupyter notebook
# exit env (runs quickly)
source deactivate
# its optional, but you can remove the env:
conda remove --name myenv --all
