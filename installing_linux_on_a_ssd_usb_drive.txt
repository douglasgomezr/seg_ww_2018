You may be interested in experimenting with Linux, but do not want to 
permanently install the operating system on your Windows computer. You might 
want to use Linux for a short class or working workshop and do not want to 
repartition your disk, or you may be forbidden to install Linux on your 
company’s computer. I have tried to use Virtual Machines and Docker, but I was 
not happy with results. Recently I installed Linux on a USB connected Solid 
State Disk and created a good experimental system.

My first experiment was with a $25 Patriot 64GB USB 3 thumb drive. I could not 
use this system for simple web browsing. I heard that I should use a Solid 
State Disk (SSD). SSD was reputed to be much faster then a flash Drive.

I tried a $117 Samsung 250GB SSD and a $35 iRecadata 64GB connected with USB3 
and created systems that function well. They are a little faster than my 5 year
old Macbook Pro which continues to serve me well. The runtime to download a 2D 
land seismic line and apply simple time preprocessing using the Madagascar 
package on these systems are:

2013 Macbook Pro – 2.6 gGHz i7 16 GB memory
Real time 2m 46s CP time 1m 14s
2018 Asus/Samsung 250 GB USB3 SSD
Real time 1m 56s CP time 1m 2s
2018 Asus/iRecadata 64 GB USB3 SSD
Real time 1m 43s CP time 1m 3s

I purchased the USB3 connected SSD at Amazon. 

To enable booting a Windows 10 computer from a usb drive I followed 
instructions at:https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1030858/

I installed Linux using instructions at 
https://askubuntu.com/questions/170454/can-i-install-ubuntu-to-my-32-gb-usb-pen-drive. Look for “how to install Ubuntu To USB Drives. This URL is much better 
than another site that claims to be “the easy way”.

I hope you find this information useful. Share your experience with me.
